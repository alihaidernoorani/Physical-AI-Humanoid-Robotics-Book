  "services": {
    "database": {
      "status": "string, database connection status",

    },
    "vector_db": {
      "status": "string, vector database connection status",
      "response_time_ms": "integer, response time in milliseconds"
    },
    "embedding_service": {
      "status": "string, embedding service status",

#### Response
```json
{

## Response Status Codes

- `200 OK`: System is healthy/ready/alive
- `503 Service Unavailable`: System is not healthy/ready/alive

## Health Status Meanings

- `healthy`: All services are operational and responding within expected timeframes
- `degraded`: System is operational but some services may be slower than usual or have reduced capacity
- `unhealthy`: One or more critical services are not responding or failing
- `ready`: System has completed initialization and is ready to accept requests
- `not_ready`: System is still initializing or has failed to initialize properly
- `alive`: System process is running and responding to requests
- `dead`: System process is not responding
