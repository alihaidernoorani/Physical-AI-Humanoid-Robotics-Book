# Content Verification Workflow

This workflow ensures technical accuracy while maintaining constitutional compliance.

## Verification Steps

1. **Technical Fact Checking**
   - Verify all technical claims against official documentation
   - Cross-reference with reliable sources
   - Ensure all examples are reproducible
   - Check code examples for syntax and functionality

2. **Content Accuracy**
   - Confirm all technical procedures are correct
   - Validate all software versions and dependencies mentioned
   - Verify all ROS2, NVIDIA Isaac, and related technologies are accurately described
   - Ensure all safety guidelines are properly documented

3. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Remove all external references and citations
   - Ensure content is self-contained
   - Maintain module structure and naming
   - Preserve pedagogical quality without compromising technical accuracy

## Verification Tools

- Technical documentation cross-reference
- Code example testing (where feasible)
- Peer review process
- Automated MDX validation
- Link integrity checking

## Quality Gates

- Technical claims must be verifiable
- All examples must be reproducible
- Content must be self-contained
- No external dependencies for understanding
